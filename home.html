<h1>Short bio:</h1>

	<div class="bio">Hello, I'm Paul Johnson.  Boyfriend, cat dad, and uncle to 8 nieces and nephews.  I have worked in several different careers, none related to technology, and currently I'm a tree climber/trimmer (arborist).  I have been in and out of school for ten years with lots of credits, but no degree.  Most recently, I have taken some beginner computer classes, and I enjoyed them enough to want to dive deeper into the subject.  I have lived in Lincoln, Nebraska my entire life, except for two excursions in Florida for a couple of years.  I'm constantly trying to find reasons to get back to the ocean. </div>
