	<h3 class="goalTitle">Personal goals</h3>

	<div class="personal">My main priority right now is to acquire more skills and knowledge, which I enjoy using, and contribute more value.  Another vague goal of mine is to travel more.  I would like to go everywhere, but more realistically, I would like to get out to Colorado and a couple of places in Canada this year. </div>

	
	<h3 class="goalTitle">Professional goals</h3>

	<div class="professional">Over the next year I would like to gain the development/programming/etc skills to be qualified to contribute to a business as an intern/junior developer/etc.  From there as I gain more real world experience, I will be better positioned to know what I am interested in, and where my strengths lie.  I also plan on moving to Omaha, for a change of scenery, and possibly to finish out a degree at a local college.</div>
